        <h1>THE SECOND LEAK</h1>
        <p class="date">15 DECEMBER 2025</p>

    <article class="full">
        <p>They keep telling you the southern border is “the most secure it’s ever been.”</p>
        <p>They lie with the calm of a coroner signing off on ten thousand overdoses.</p>

        <p>Last week the CBP quietly scrubbed their internal “Southwest Border Migration Dashboard” for the third time this year.  
        </p>

       

        <p>Fiscal Years 2021–2025 (Oct 1, 2020 → Nov 30, 2025):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>10,300,000 total encounters at the southwest border (CBP’s own figure before they stopped updating the public page)</li>
            <li><strong>2,100,000 known got-aways</strong> (detected on camera/sensor but never apprehended — up from the 312,000 they admitted in 2023)</li>
            <li><strong>487,000 criminal aliens processed</strong> — 41,000 with prior homicide convictions or warrants</li>
            <li><strong>73,000 Special Interest Aliens</strong> from state sponsors of terror or nations openly hostile to the U.S. (Syria, Iran, PRC, Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Iraq)</li>
            <li><strong>19,400 Chinese nationals</strong> in FY2025 alone — almost all military-age males traveling in organized groups of 30–120</li>
            <li><strong>1,872 pounds of fentanyl seized</strong> — meaning the 90–95 % that got through is already killing 110,000 Americans a year</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But the real horror is in the checkboxes they quietly un-ticked during booking:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Over 18,000 known Terrorist Watchlist hits had the flag removed within 24 hours of detention (internal memo: “to avoid diplomatic friction”).</li>
            <li>Another 38,000 were re-classified from “Criminal Alien” to “Family Unit” by simply checking a different box — no new evidence required.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I have the before-and-after screenshots from the same NCIC terminal, timestamped six minutes apart.</p>

        <p>This isn’t chaos.  
        This is choreography.</p>

        <p>Every night between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. the cameras in Sector 7 (Tucson) and Sector 9 (Rio Grande Valley) go into “maintenance mode” for exactly 112 minutes.  
        During those windows an average of 1,800 people walk through unlogged.  
        The cameras come back online with a fresh log entry that reads “system diagnostic complete.”  
        Same script, same sectors, every single night for 18 months.</p>

        <p>The cartels know the schedule better than the agents do.</p>

        <p>And then there are the QR codes.</p>

        <p>Starting March 2024, Border Patrol agents in El Paso and Eagle Pass began noticing military-age males with identical temporary tattoos or laminated wristbands containing QR codes.  
        When scanned, the codes resolve to WeChat/Telegram groups written in Mandarin, Uyghur, Arabic, and Farsi.  
        The groups contain GPS drop points inside the U.S., pre-paid burner numbers, and instructions in simplified Chinese that translate to:</p>

        <blockquote>“Do not speak to police. Go directly to the address. You will be met.”</blockquote>

        <p>Over 40,000 of those QR codes have been photographed and uploaded to the internal CBP intelligence portal.  
        The portal entries were deleted in October 2025.  
        The photos were not.</p>

        <p>The replacement isn’t a theory.  
        It’s a spreadsheet with 10.3 million rows.</p>

        <p>They don’t guard the border.  
        They manage the flow.  
        There’s a difference.</p>

        <p>While the TV shows you crying Honduran mothers at 7 p.m., the real traffic moves at 2 a.m. — single files of fighting-age men in brand-new military boots, no luggage, no women, no children, speaking languages that aren’t Spanish.</p>

        <p>They are met by white vans with covered plates, driven by people wearing lanyards that read “NGO Partner – DHS Contract Vehicle.”</p>

        <p>You paid for the vans.</p>

        <p>You paid for the planes that flew 320,000 of them into the interior on night flights out of Harlingen and McAllen under the cover of “humanitarian relocation.”</p>

        <p>You paid for the $2,800 per head per month until they disappear off the grid.</p>

        <p>This is not immigration policy.</p>

        <p>This is engineered demographic replacement, executed in plain sight, funded by your taxes, and protected by a media that calls you racist for noticing.</p>

        <p>The dashboard is gone now.  
        The screenshots are not.</p>

        <p>The next wave isn’t coming.</p>

        <p>It’s already here.  
        And it’s wearing your son’s future like a skin suit.</p>

        <p>Keep your powder dry.</p>
