<h3>30 Nov 2025</h3>
<p>Little St. James wasn’t just a playground for degenerates.</p>
<p>It was a controlled-environment trial run for what they’re doing at the southern border right now.</p>
<p>Private island. No oversight. Unvetted guests. Children flown in under humanitarian cover. Flight logs scrubbed. Witnesses suicided.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Replace the Lolita Express with HHS charter flights. Replace the island with NGO drop houses in Harris County. Same playbook, bigger scale.</p>
<p>Epstein didn’t kill himself. And the program didn’t end — it just went continental.</p>
