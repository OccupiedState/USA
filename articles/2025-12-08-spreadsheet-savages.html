<h3>08 Dec 2025</h3>
<p>The quietest invasion in history runs on CSV files and federal grants.</p>
<p>Catholic Charities pulled in more taxpayer cash in four years than from collection plates in a century. Endeavors, a company with zero shelter experience, got $600 million in no-bid contracts because its former CEO sat on Biden’s transition team. Average bounty: $6,800 per head delivered alive.</p>
<p>They don’t need tanks. They have Excel.</p>
<p>Every “unaccompanied minor” is a line item. Every got-away is a rounding error. The wall isn’t concrete and steel anymore — it’s a spreadsheet cell that someone quietly changes from red to green.</p>
<p>This is how republics die in the 21st century: not with a bang, but with a pivot table.</p>
